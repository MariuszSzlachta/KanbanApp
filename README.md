# Kanban--app

## What's this?

## Functionality

1. You can add, remove lanes.
2. You can add, remove, edit, drag between lanes.

## Known issues

Because problem occurred with hosting app on heroku I had to merge dependencies with dev dependencies to solve issue. I decided to add package_old.json file where dependencies are separated and starting scripts looks slightly different.
